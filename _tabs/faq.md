Will travel or accommodation be provided?
: No. We are unable to provide travel or accommodation for participants. We recommend looking for accommodations either 1) near Mila in Little Italy or Mile-end or 2) in downtown Montreal. If you are also attending COSYNE, it may be convenient to book the same accommodations that you are using for COSYNE. From the COSYNE conference hotel (Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth), Mila is a 40-minute ride + walk using public transit or a 25-minute drive/ride-share. There will be a group leaving the COSYNE conference hotel lobby at around 7:50 AM to travel to Mila.

Who is eligible to participate?
: Anyone with some programming experience is welcome to participate! However, you must apply in advance and, due to space constraints, we may not be able to accommodate everyone.

Are there prizes?
: Unlike a traditional industry hackathon, there are no prizes. This hackathon is designed to encourage collaboration not competition.
