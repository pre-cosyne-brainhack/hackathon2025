Introduction
============

Although Pre-COSYNE Brainhack is not associated with the COSYNE conference, we follow an adapted version of the COSYNE Code of Conduct (below) as well as the [Brainhack Code](https://brainhack.org/code-of-conduct) of Conduct.

Purpose
=======

At Pre-COSYNE Brainhack, we strive for open and honest intellectual debate as part of a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. This requires a community and an environment that recognizes and respects the inherent worth of every person.

Sources
=======

This code of conduct is based on standards and language set at other meetings, whose organizing boards convened special working groups of scientific and legal experts to set their policies. We follow, in particular, those guidelines established for the Gordon Research Conferences, the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting, and NeurIPS.

The following code of conduct has been adapted from:

Responsibilities
================

All participants, volunteers, organizers, reviewers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers (referred to as “Participants” collectively throughout this document) at Pre-COSYNE Brainhack--- are required to agree with this Code of Conduct both during an event and on official communication channels, including social media. Sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, sponsors should not use images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature. This code applies both to official sponsors as well as any organization that uses the Pre-COSYNE Brainhack name as branding as part of its activities at or around Pre-COSYNE Brainhack.

Organizers will enforce this Code, and it is expected that all Participants will cooperate to help ensure a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.

Policy
======

The conference commits itself to providing an experience for all Participants that is free from the following:

* **Harassment, bullying, discrimination** which includes but is not limited to:
  * Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.
  * intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks or other conference events.
* **Inappropriate or unprofessional behavior** that interferes with another's full participation including:
  * Sexual harassment, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome attention, public vulgar exchanges, derogatory name-calling, and diminutive characterizations.
  * Use of images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature that may create an inappropriate or toxic environment.
  * Disorderly, boisterous, or disruptive conduct including fighting, coercion, theft, damage to property, or any mistreatment or non-businesslike behavior towards participants.
  * “Zoom bombing” or any virtual activity that is not related to the topic of discussion which detracts from the topic or the purpose of the program. This includes inappropriate remarks in chat areas as deemed inappropriate by presenters/monitors/event leaders.
* **Scientific misconduct:** including fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism of paper submissions or research presentations, including demos, exhibits or posters.

This Code of Conduct applies to the actual meeting sites and venues where Pre-COSYNE Brainhack business is being conducted, including physical venues, online venues, and official virtual engagement platforms, including video, virtual streaming, and chat-based interactions. Pre-COSYNE Brainhack is not responsible for non-sponsored activity or behavior that may occur at non-sponsored locations such as hotels, restaurants, or physical or virtual locations not otherwise a sanctioned space for sponsored events. Nonetheless, any issues brought to the Organizers will be explored. Moreover, Pre-COSYNE Brainhack will not actively monitor social media platforms but will follow up on issues of harassment and violations of the code of conduct that occur on those platforms that are specifically related to the Pre-COSYNE Brainhack program, during the course of Pre-COSYNE Brainhack, if and when they are brought to our attention.

Complaint Reporting
===================

The Conference encourages all Participants to immediately report any incidents of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional conduct, and/or retaliation so that complaints can be quickly and fairly resolved. There will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits an incident report in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. If you have concerns related to your participation/interaction at Pre-COSYNE Brainhack or Pre-COSYNE Brainhack sanctioned events, or observe someone else's difficulties, or have any other concerns you wish to share, please write to <brainhack.cosyne@gmail.com>.

Action
======

If a Participant engages in any inappropriate behavior as defined herein, the Pre-COSYNE Brainhack Organizers may take action as deemed appropriate, including: a formal or informal warning to the offender, expulsion from the event, barring from participation in future events or their organization, reporting the incident to the offender's local institution or funding agencies, or reporting the incident to local authorities or law enforcement. A response of "just joking" is not acceptable. If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available. There will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits an incident report in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. All issues brought forth to the Pre-COSYNE Brainhack Organizers during the course of the event will be immediately investigated.
