Pre-COSYNE Brainhack is a hackathon that brings together people who are passionate about open science, open-source tools, and collaboration around computational and systems neuroscience. The hackathon provides an opportunity for people from different institutions to work together on projects of shared interest and learn from each other.

Projects can be on any topic. They can range from integrating a data visualization tool with an analysis tool, to training an LLM to extract knowledge from neuroscience papers, to creating a website to host data analysis challenges and leaderboards. The suggested theme for this year is Benchmarks and Quality Control.

Anyone is welcome to participate. Once registrations are open we'll let you know here.
