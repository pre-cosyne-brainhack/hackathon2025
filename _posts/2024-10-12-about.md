Overview
--------

The Pre-COSYNE Brainhack is a lively event that brings together people who are passionate about open science, open-source tools, and collaboration around computational and systems neuroscience.
The hackathon provides an opportunity for people from different institutions to work together on projects of shared interest and learn from each other.
Projects can be on anything from integrating a data visualization tool with an analysis tool, to training an LLM to extract knowledge from neuroscience papers, to developing a tool for tracking the usage of a software package in papers.
Everyone is welcome; you do not need to be a software engineer to participate.
Once registrations are open we'll let you know here.

This hackathon is heavily inspired by the [OHBM Hackathon](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2024/), [BrainHack](https://brainhack.org/), and [EBRAINS](https://www.ebrains.eu/) / [HBP](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/) / [NeuralEnsemble](https://neuralensemble.org) CodeJam events.
Pre-COSYNE Brainhack is not an official part of the [COSYNE conference](https://www.cosyne.org/).

> If you cannot attend but would like to be notified of future events, please [join for our mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdH_LikO1-7HiVcM-Utu9r_0GEWcSiuwcFLck7f9zZgKC9OOw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Dates
-----

The hackathon runs from **March 25–26, 2025** — the two days preceding the COSYNE conference.
It consists of brief project pitches at the start, brief project presentations at the end, and an [unconference session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) in the middle where participants can give brief talks on topics of shared interest.
The rest of the time is dedicated to hacking and meals.
The event runs from 8:30 AM to around 6:30 PM on both days, though participants are welcome to hack together into the night.
See our [schedule](/hackathon2025/schedule) for further details.

> Since the hackathon is relatively short in duration, participants are strongly encouraged to arrive in Montreal by 6 PM the day before the hackathon (Mar. 24) to join other participants for dinner and socializing. Participants are strongly encouraged to stay through the Simons Foundation social at the end of the second day.

Topics and Team Formation
-------------------------

Upon registration, each participant will be asked to select a set of interests related to the hackathon themes.
Using the interests provided, we will select teams in a pseudo-randomized manner to promote a mix of backgrounds and ideas and to encourage collaboration among participants who may not know each other.
We are excited to see the innovative projects that will arise from this format and look forward to an inspiring and productive hackathon!
